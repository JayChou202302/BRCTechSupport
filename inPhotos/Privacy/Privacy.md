1. How the company collects your personal information

 <br>inPhotos will only collect and use your personal information for the following purposes described in this policy:
 <br>We collect data based on your interactions with us and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. The data we collect may include SDK/API/JS code version, browser, Internet service provider, IP address, platform, timestamp, application identifier, application version, application distribution channel, independent device identifier, iOS advertising identifier (IDFA), network card (MAC) address, device model, terminal manufacturer, terminal device operating system version, session start/stop time, language location, time zone and network status (WiFi, etc.), hard disk, CPU and battery usage, etc. When we want to use information for other purposes not specified in this policy, we will ask for your consent in advance. 
 <br>In order to protect personal privacy, you should not provide any other information except that specifically requested by the Company. 
 <br>2. How the Company uses your personal information
 <br>1. Use your personal information to send you service information of the Company's mobile app.
 <br>2. Except for the reorganization, merger or sale of the Company, which can transfer all personal information collected by us to relevant third parties, the Company will not provide, sell, rent, share or trade your personal information to any unrelated third party, unless you have obtained your prior permission, or the third party and the Company provide services to you individually or jointly, and after the end of the service, it will be prohibited from accessing all the information that it could previously access. 
 <br>3. Personal Information Security
 <br>It is very important for us to ensure the security of your personal data. When you generate personal data while using the Company's mobile app, we will use secure socket layer technology (SSL) to transmit this information. <br>In the two stages of data transmission and data storage, we will protect the information you submit to us through widely accepted industry standards. However, no Internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure. Therefore, although we protect your personal information through commercially acceptable means, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of information. <br>Fourth, how long will the company keep personal information
 <br>Generally speaking, the company will only retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purpose of collection, and will comply with the data retention period required by applicable laws.

 <br>We have the right to disclose your personal information when required by law and when the company believes that it is necessary to disclose information about you to protect the company's legal rights and/or comply with judicial proceedings, court orders or legal proceedings applicable to the company's mobile apps.
 <br>If the company determines that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce the company's terms and conditions or protect our operations, we may disclose information about you. 
 <br>Six, changes to this privacy policy
 <br>If we decide to change the privacy policy, we will post these changes in this policy, on the company's website, and in other places we deem appropriate so that you can understand how we collect and use your personal information, who can access this information, and under what circumstances we will disclose this information.
